This is a complete project completed independently as part of a class assignment. I selected this task.

Compilation instructions:

1) In the 'source_code' folder find the file 'Naous_Karim_Final_CS395.ipynb'

2) Open an internet browser and visit Google Colab at: https://colab.research.google.com/

3) In the toolbar, click File > Upload Notebook > Choose File and upload the .ipynb file. You may need to create a Google Account.

4) Once that is done, you should have access to the source code. You can run the code now. You may be asked to upload data. When this happens upload *both* .csv files in the folder named 'upload'. 

5) The code is pre-run, but you can run it again by clicking the Play button on each code block.
